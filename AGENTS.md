# AGENTS.md — zed-pkg/zed-mcp-server.rs

## Parent / root agent contract

This file is **this repository's** agent contract. The fleet-wide parent lives at:

- GitHub: https://github.com/oresoftware/my-ai/AGENTS.md
- Disk: `~/codes/oresoftware/my-ai/AGENTS.md`
- `~/codes/AGENTS.md` is a symlink to `~/codes/oresoftware/my-ai/AGENTS.md`
- Installed by `~/codes/oresoftware/my-ai/setup-final.sh` (not `.md`) as symlinks onto:
  - `~/codes/AGENTS.md`
  - `~/codes/.claude/AGENTS.md` and `~/codes/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
  - `~/codes/.cursor/AGENTS.md` and `~/codes/.cursor/.cursorrules`
  - `~/codes/.chatgpt/AGENTS.md`
  - `~/codes/.openai/AGENTS.md`
  - `~/codes/.anthropic/AGENTS.md`

When this file and the parent disagree: follow **this file** for this MCP
server's tools, safety boundary, and env layout; follow the parent for org-wide
git/Linear/GitHub/k8s/shared-auth/opto-sync/ores-otel/zed-pkg conventions.

The mapping is 1:1:1:1 — GitHub org : Linear project : GitHub org project
(usually `https://github.com/orgs/<org>/projects/1`) : Slack channel in
`oresoftware-workspace.slack.com`. Linear workspace: https://linear.app/denman
Primary GitHub user: `ORESoftware`. Secondary: `the1mills`.


## This repository

- GitHub org: [`zed-pkg`](https://github.com/zed-pkg)
- Repository: [`zed-pkg/zed-mcp-server.rs`](https://github.com/zed-pkg/zed-mcp-server.rs)
- Local checkout: `~/codes/zed-pkg/zed-mcp-server.rs`
- Linear project: https://linear.app/denman/project/githubcomzed-pkg-5a53230ae6cc
- GitHub org project: https://github.com/orgs/zed-pkg/projects/1
- Sibling test org: `github.com/zed-pkg-test` (external/e2e coverage and extra GHA minutes)
- Slack workspace: oresoftware-workspace.slack.com
- Kind: read-only organization MCP inherited from `ORESoftware/org-mcp-server-template.rs` / `ore-mcp-org-server`
- Package / service name: `zed-mcp-server`

Shared backends this org should lean on (see parent file for detail):

- `github.com/shared-auth` — dual auth
- `github.com/opto-sync` — cross-device sync
- `github.com/ores-otel` — logs, traces, metrics (stderr JSON + OTLP; stdout is MCP JSON-RPC only)
- `github.com/zed-pkg` — dependency intent (`.zpkg.toml`)
- `github.com/oresoftware/k8s-cluster` — deploy (except fiducia-cloud node/brain)

## MCP safety for this server

- Tools on this server: `org_identity`, `zed_dependency_graph`, `telemetry_status`, `shared_auth_policy`, `environment_policy`, `security_baseline`.
- stdout is the MCP wire. Diagnostics and telemetry go to stderr only.
- Never log, return, or serialize secret values. Capability checks report names/presence only.
- Do not add filesystem write, kubectl mutation, credentialed SSRF, or unauthenticated non-loopback HTTP without a dedicated review.
- Git: merge, never rebase/stash/reset unless a human explicitly authorizes. Resolve conflicts semantically.

## Encrypted environment (sops + age + just + nix)

Secrets are committed as ciphertext only:

```
env/enc/dev.env.enc     committed ciphertext (source of truth)
env/enc/prod.env.enc    committed ciphertext (protected-operator recipients)
env/dec/*.env           gitignored plaintext, mode 0600, disposable
.env                    managed symlink into env/dec/ only
```

```sh
nix develop                 # or: direnv allow  (.envrc uses the flake)
just env-keygen             # once per machine
just env-decrypt            # env/enc -> env/dec
just env-use dev            # .env -> env/dec/dev.env
just env-run dev cargo test # no plaintext file
just env-check              # fail-closed; CI runs this
```

Private age keys live only in `~/Library/Application Support/sops/age/keys.txt`
(macOS) or `~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt` (Linux), mode 0600. `.just/env.just`
and `.just/dotenv.py` are the shared ores-sops module — keep them byte-identical
across the fleet; do not fork them in this repo.

## Required validation

```sh
just check          # if defined
just env-check
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --locked --all-targets
```

## Code style and coding patterns

remember to modularize the rust, typescript and dart - not everything belongs in main.rs, main.ts and main.dart; also follow functional coding principles - fewer side-effects (use pure functions more), more immutability (immutable variables); but for stateful apps like the client or stateful servers like websockets or tcp connections, sometimes classes and oop make more sense than functional programming perse, but we can still adhere to functional programming more than usual. Favor exhaustive pattern matching and use formal methods checking too. Favor composability and re-use , so basically create more utility functions and routines for shared use. You can follow a medium level of D.R.Y. (don't repeat yourself) - in other words you can repeat yourself at medium amount (not too much not too little). Some chaining is totally fine, so either method-chaining (immutable sometimes although with classes can be mutable too for performance), and chaining via the pipe operator is ok in languages like gleamlang.

Functional programming is mostly the following:

+ explicit inputs
+ explicit outputs
+ immutable values
+ pure transformations
+ typed errors
+ explicit state transitions
+ composition
+ effects pushed outward
+ illegal states excluded by types

## Repository-local Git worktrees

- Create or use a Git worktree only when the human operator explicitly authorizes it for the current task. Concurrency or a dirty checkout is not permission by itself.
- Put every authorized worktree at `<repository-root>/tmp/worktrees/<name>`; from the repository root, use `./tmp/worktrees/<name>`. Never place worktrees beside repositories or organization directories.
- Keep `tmp`, `temp`, `tmp/worktrees`, and `temp/worktrees` ignored in the repository-root `.gitignore`. Do not commit files from those directories.
- Relocate or remove a worktree only when the operator explicitly requests it. Before removal, preserve and publish intended changes, verify its commit is represented on the target branch, and confirm there are no tracked, untracked, ignored-sensitive, or in-use files that must survive. Remove it with `git worktree remove <path>` without `--force`; never delete a worktree directory with `rm`.
